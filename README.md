# 3dMinesweeper
A collab project with a friend of mine in computer science, inspired by a friend of ours. He did the Java and I did the Python. He created 3d minesweeper and I solved it.

# Java
The java code is the actual 3d minesweeper itself. I think if you run it, you could play a very sketchy game of command line 3dminesweeper but that doesn't seem like a great idea. If you're curious, I would suggest [this version online](http://egraether.com/mine3d/). 

If you want more info on the java code, check out the java doc in the docs folder.

# Python
They python code is the AI that solves 3d minesweeper. This is the code that you will actually be running if you want to try it yourself.

For more info, check out the python doc in the docs folder

## Steps to Run:
1. Download the code and navigate to the directory in the command line.
2. Run the python code, and follow the prompts
3. It'll print out the most basic information to the command prompt, such as if it won and the board. For more indepth info, check the logs folder
